# Postly

The **Postly** is a simple yet functional social media platform that allows users to create posts, manage their profiles, follow other users, and view a personalized news feed. Built using **Flask** for the backend and **JavaScript** for the frontend, this project demonstrates essential web development practices such as user authentication, API development, and data management with **SQLite** as the database.

I created 'postly' as a final project of [cs50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/), an introduction to computer science and the art of programming.
